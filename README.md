# Express

## What is it ?
Express is a Web Framework for Node.js

## Why do I need it ?

It makes the coding easier by its APIs.

U can focus on ur main business and logic and do not caring about those technical details such as HTTP, just use them with APIs.

## What is the difference between HTTP modules in Node.js and HTTP modules in Express ? Why dont I use native Node.js ?

Express encapsulate some Node.js modules to make them a much better and easier using. U can still using native Node.js without any trouble at the same time.
